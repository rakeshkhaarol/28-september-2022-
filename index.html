                PANAJI: The Goa government has issued guidelines restricting the harvesting of clams except by people living within a 5-km radius from the site and asked them to ensure that only clams and oysters larger than 3cm be harvested.

                The guidelines are designed to ensure “sustainable utilisation, conservation and management of bioresources” for controlled harvesting and conservation of edible clams. It applies to the entire state, the order notified by the government last week said.
